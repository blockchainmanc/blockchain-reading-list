## About Blockchain Manchester

### Who are we?

An set of developers based in Manchester interested in all things Blockchain. 

### Goals

[Andy Gray](https://github.com/andygray) and [James Morgan](https://github.com/jamesmorgan) have been interested in Blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and decentralised technologies for several years.

We're setting up Blockchain Manchester for these reasons:

* To learn more about Blockchain through sharing ideas and working within the sphere
* Meet other people in the North (of England) with similar interests and ideas
* Build a network of like minded individuals
* Grow our reputation (individually and as a network) for working with and understanding Blockchains
* Build proof-of-concept use-cases/examples that can be presented (and potentially leveraged in the future)
* Engage with people and companies working with Blockchain technology in whatever capacity
